background: This is the third of a series of public meetings to update the Georgetown-Scott County Comprehensive Plan. At this meeting, we will review draft goals and objectives developed as part of the 2016 Comprehensive Plan.<br><br>Kentucky Revised Statues (KRS 100) specify that the planning commission of each unit shall prepare a comprehensive plan, which shall serve as a guide for public and private actions and decisions to assure the development of public and private property in the most appropriate relationships. A required element of the comprehensive plan, per KRS 100, is a statement of goals and objectives.<br><br>The goals and objectives serve as the foundation for the Comprehensive Plan and provide policy guidance in the preparation of other elements of the plan including potential strategies for implementation. The goals and objectives are a guide to assist decision makers as specified by KRS and should not be viewed as a regulatory document. These goals have been developed over several months of public committee work, and public meetings. They reflect the overall desire of the community; each particular goal and objective may or may not be applicable or appropriate in every instance; and decision makers should consider them as appropriate.
