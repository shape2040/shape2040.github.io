page-category: subcommittee
weight: 4
description: Scott County attracts new residents, visitors, and businesses with its heritage and built environment, while retaining its small-town character and historic sites.  Educational opportunities regarding our communityâ€™s history and buildings is readily available to the public through the Scott County Museum, Georgetown/Scott County Tourism Commission, local heritage sites, and educational programming.  A series of overlay districts for historic downtown areas and major corridors protect and enhance our historic resources and commercial districts through preservation, design guidelines, and predictable urban form.
principles:
  - p: Our local heritage is an asset to the community; our heritage includes cultural resources and knowledge, history, traditions, historic buildings, and historic sites.
  - p: Preservation of historic sites and structures helps retain our local culture and heritage.
  - p: New construction and renovation should complement existing character and form. Quality materials and consistent design add value to the overlay areas and to the community as a whole.
  - p: Our downtowns (Georgetown, Sadieville, and Stamping Ground) play a major role in our cultural identify, local governance, and economic activity.  Care should be given to retain and enhance our downtown buildings and character, which have a vast history of incremental development, resilience, and change over time.
  - p: Community gateways and major commercial corridors (areas) are designed for all, with consideration for aesthetics, accessibility, and design at the human-scale. Design with these characteristics in mind enhances user experience.
