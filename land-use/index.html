description: Scott County’s urban areas provide&#58; 1) Diversity of uses – which allows interaction and connectivity between land uses and transportation modes, 2) Distinct neighborhoods – which have strong character and equitable access, 3) Dedicated focus to our downtowns – which are the heart of each of our three cities, 4) Employment centers – where industrial and commercial activity are able to thrive and produce for the county and region, 5) Accessible institutions (schools, etc.) – which are distributed throughout the community, allowing for integration and collaboration, and 6) Natural and open spaces – which are identified and protected through acquisition, stewardship, and responsible site planning, and which are incorporated as vital components of our infrastructure and economy. 7) Transportation/connectivity with multi-access points between residential neighborhoods and community areas.

  - p: The greenbelt acts as a land use buffer between urban and rural areas.
  - p: Growth should occur predominately within existing urban areas.
  - p: Urban centers should be strengthened through incentives, infill and adaptive reuse of existing buildings, incremental and sustainable growth.  
  - p: Main corridors into urban centers in Scott County should be planned to provide aesthetically pleasing and functional entryways.
  - p: Neighborhoods should have diverse housing that is both high quality and accessible to varying income levels. Affordable high/low split commercial centers, parks, and other public spaces should be integrated to create dynamic neighborhoods with access to daily needs.
