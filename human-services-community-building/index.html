description: Scott County benefits from a high quality of life, accessible public services, and collaborative community partnerships.  Our community offers arts, cultural, educational, health and wellness, recreational and parks programs, and financial resources to improve equity and access for those in need.  Community members have diverse and welcoming locations and opportunities to gather, to play and learn together, and support each other in times of need.  Affordable housing is available, accessible, and kept in good condition, and homeless individuals have access to housing, food, and workforce training.
