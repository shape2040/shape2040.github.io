                <h2>Land Use</h2>
                <p>In each city researched, there seemed to be similar theme regarding current and future land use. New development is favored to provide multi-modal oriented site design and attractive streetscapes that are flexible to allow changes over time without detracting from the quality of the area. Preventing sprawl is important and each city/county has objectives/text in the comprehensive plan to create a vibrant commercial zone to help new businesses support existing businesses. The communities researched favor infill in more targeted urban areas. Development should be mixed use and these areas and designed/considered as &ldquo;places&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;developments.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Georgetown, KY</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc">
                    <li><b>New Development: </b>New development in Commercial Districts will be encouraged to locate and design buildings such that a percentage of building fronts directly face adjacent streets, provide a mix of types and sizes of businesses, provide pedestrian oriented site design, and incorporate convenient, safe and attractive parking areas into the block. (urban land use element page 6)</li>
                    <li><b>Street Tree Design: </b>Street trees should be used in a formal architectural fashion to reinforce, define, and connect the space and corridors created by buildings and other features along the street. Canopy shade trees will constitute the majority of tree plantings, and a mixture of tree types will be included, arranged to establish partial urban tree canopy cover. Existing trees will be preserved to the maximum extent feasible. (urban land use element page 8)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Ashland, KY</h3>
                <p>Commercial development should minimize curb cuts on roadways and maintain a defined roadway edge with specific points for ingress/egress; shared driveways with cross-development access should be required when possible. (pg 41)</p>
                <h3>Dublin, OH</h3>
                <p>With few exceptions, the City&rsquo;s land use is distinguished by large scale, single-use, geographically segregated developments. To provide an alternative development choice, mixed use areas that more fully integrate uses and activities will be important. These areas should be thought of as &ldquo;places&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;developments&rdquo; and should be distinctive in their identity. The form, character and mix of uses should create vitality and facilitate opportunities to walk and bike within these places. Form and architecture should be flexible to allow uses to change over time without detracting from the quality of the area. (Land Use objective)</p>

                <ul class="list-disc">
                    <li>&ldquo;The Town should consider green building incentives at the local level for developers who consider the use of the LEED rating system for buildings and/or developments&rdquo; (land use plan Page 58)</li>

Pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and bus riders of all ages and abilities are able to safely move along and across a complete street. By rebalancing the transportation system in Boone, the quality of the resident and visitor experiences in activity nodes can be enhanced, the sense of community will be enriched, and the overall quality of life in Boone will be improved.

                <h2>Agriculture &amp; Environment</h2>
                <p>All of the cities researched view farmland as the vital part of the community, and include specific language/measures in each comprehensive plan to preserve farmland and deter development from those outermost rural areas in the counties/cities. In areas that growth is expected to increase, there are different policies in place to help protect vital farming areas.</p>
                <h3>Dublin, OH</h3>
                <p>Most of Dublin was at one time under farmland cultivation or used as pasture for livestock. Dublin&rsquo;s agricultural roots evoke powerful images: open fields, stone and brick farmhouses, barns and outbuildings, and hedge rows and trees that define property boundaries. While areas to the north and west of Dublin remain in agricultural use or in fallow fields, continued development will require efforts to preserve these clear ties to the city&rsquo;s historic past.</p>
                <h3>Ashland, KY</h3>
                <p>Environmentally sensitive areas that should not be developed but may be utilized, in strategic and limited manners, as park and/or open space; these areas can provide educational and interpretative opportunities for the youth and public. (pg 42)</p>
                <h3>Boone County, Kentucky</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc">
                    <li>5% of the 658 farms in the county are classified as small family farms (&lt;$250,000 in sales)</li>
                    <li>Comparable to the 85% in Scott county where the 15% being large production farms</li>
                    <li>It is apparent that future development of the county's rural areas will occur. In order to protect those who want to continue to farm, tax structures, planning efforts, Purchase of Development Rights (PDR), incentive programs, conservation easements, and utility expansions should be explored. A combination of these tools should be used instead of concentrating on a single solution.</li>
                    <li>A good farmer&rsquo;s market network should supplement the successful Boone County Farmer&rsquo;s Market to link producers with grocers and customers.</li>

                <h2>Heritage &amp; Urban Form</h2>
                <p>Each city/county researched strives to create a vibrant downtown area that is seen as the focal point of the community. Multi-use development is preferred, as well as increased accessibility from all forms of transportation. Preserving historical buildings and places in downtown is important, but upgrading these places for increased accessibility/usability is favored.</p>

                    <li>A master plan should be prepared that identifies scenic elements along the corridor and at the gateways. The plan should also identify problem areas where improvements in the way of landscape planting and/or screening or other measures are recommended. The intent of the plan is to maintain and preserve significant visual assets within the gateway corridors and to enhance the visual appearance at problem areas and key locations at the entrances to the community. The plan should make specific recommendations as to projects and establish priorities for accomplishing gateway enhancements (pg 13)</li>

                <h3>Danville, IL</h3>
                <p>Like many manufacturing communities in the Midwest, Danville has suffered a declining economic and employment base in the last few decades due to changes in industrial sectors, location preferences, and the national economy. The economy in and around the City of Danville has struggled in recent years for a number of reasons. For example, a lack of private investment in the community coupled with the continued aging and deterioration of City neighborhoods and infrastructure is limiting the growth of the community. This in turn is driving up property tax rates, which is further hampering growth. The area also lacks a major regional employer or public entity to bring new jobs and development into the area so the economy is primarily isolated and self-supporting (pg 10)</p>

                <p>Quality housing is noted throughout all cities/counties researched. Most of the communities project exponential growth in the coming years and need places to house the growing population. Diverse housing is looked at in each community. Rural and urban living, multi and single family homes as well as connectivity to other areas of the community and accessibility to multi-modal transportation. Complete systems of parks and recreational facilities are desired throughout the community and multi-modal accessibility to parks is favored in each community. Complete &amp; green streets, public transportation, downtown parking, and bike/pedestrian lanes are seen throughout each comprehensive plan as being very important for the growing diverse population.</p>

Green streets assist in the reduction of stormwater runoff by diverting stormwater from the sanitary sewer system, reducing basement flooding, sewer backups, and combined sewer overflows and therefore improving general water quality. As a permitted community under the Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (KPDES), the City of Bardstown is required to meet certain water quality provisions of the EPA&rsquo;s Water Quality Act of 1987. Thus, green streets provide a practical and cost-effective approach to address Bardstown&rsquo;s permitting obligation.</li>
